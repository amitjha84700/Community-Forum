            <p class="article">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When it comes to unadulterated picture quality, nothing quite matches up to the crispy deep blacks
                 of an OLED TV mounted within a dimly lit showroom. That descriptor “dimly lit” is important, because take it out
                  in the living room and the stellar contrast of an OLED can be drowned out by reflections. In these conditions, 
                  OLED is arguably outperformed by the competing display types that get brighter. 
                  That is to say, OLED TVs are not unequivocally superior in all aspects — the technology has its disadvantages, 
                  and it’s constantly being iterated over to combat its shortcomings.
            </p>
            <p class="article">Taking CES 2022 by storm, the next big thing in the advancement of OLEDs is what 
                Samsung Display calls QD-OLED, or Quantum Dot OLED. The display company claims that new TVs which use this technology 
                will be brighter, more colorful, and have better viewing angles than conventional OLED TVs. Another exciting development 
                is that this technology won’t be restricted to just TVs, but it will also make its way towards PC monitors — a first for 
                consumer OLEDs sized for actual desks.
            </p>
            <p class="article">This new variant of OLED adds a quantum dot layer to the display stack, 
                a technique that had previously only been used on LCD panels (via QLED). The purpose of these quantum dots is to produce 
                highly saturated subpixels without using an organic high-purity light source of the same color, which are often costly or 
                inefficient. Another method to accomplish this is by using color filters, which is what OLED TVs have been using up until now.
            </p>

            <img class="img" src="images/G1.png" width="50%">

            <h2 class="aHead">What’s the difference between QD-OLED and older OLED?</h2>
            <p class="article">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To explain this, we first must understand how previous OLED TVs are structured.
                 OLED is an umbrella term that can house various subsets of technologies within. But when marketing uses the 
                 term “OLED” for TVs, they are more often than not referring to W-OLED.
            </p>
            <p class="article">For the past decade, LG Display has held a monopoly in the panels used for OLED TVs. 
                These panels were all W-OLED displays that use an RGBW pixel structure, meaning that each pixel is made up of four 
                different-colored subpixels: red, green, blue, and white. However, at its core, each subpixel is actually a white subpixel 
                (hence the term W-OLED), and colored subpixels are achieved with a color filter that blocks out parts of the white light 
                spectrum to produce red, green, or blue. Because light is being subtracted from the light source for the three colored 
                subpixels, this pixel structure is not the most efficient, and it’s the reason why an extra white subpixel is needed. 
                The fourth white subpixel does not have any color filter, and its purpose is for improved efficiency and brightness.
            </p>
            <p class="article">Quantum dots, on the other hand, convert a light source from one color to another, and almost 
                none of the original light source is wasted in this conversion. Instead of starting with a broad white spectrum 
                for each subpixel and stripping away parts of it with color filters, QD-OLED starts with a simple blue light source 
                and converts it into high-purity red and green subpixels while leaving the blue subpixels untouched.
            </p>
            <img class="img" src="images/G2.png" width="50%">
            <p class="article">With this efficient method, a fourth white subpixel is not needed, and QD-OLED can make use of 
                a normal RGB pixel structure. One of the disadvantages of current W-OLED TVs is that relying on the extra 
                white subpixel for additional brightness lowers the maximum color saturation as the display nears 
                its peak brightness; the color volume is further reduced since color filters lose effectiveness at high 
                brightness. QD-OLED, on the other hand, can maintain full saturation up to the maximum white level of the 
                display. Additionally, without a fourth subpixel, the RGB subpixels can be made larger to fill the extra space, 
                increasing their luminous output.
            </p>

            <h2 class="aHead">Why use a blue light source?</h2>
            <p class="article">In the visible light spectrum, blue light has the shortest wavelength among red, green, 
                and blue; thus it has the highest normalized energy. The quantum dot layer can essentially confine the higher 
                energy of the blue light down to red or green light, but the opposite is not possible — you cannot use 
                lower-energy red or green light to create blue light.
            </p>

            <h2 class="aHead">Why not just use true red, green, and blue light sources? Why go through all this trouble?</h2>
            <p class="article">The biggest reason is to increase the life expectancy of the display panel. When you’re paying 
                top-dollar for a TV, you probably want it to last a long time. Organic light sources inevitably grow dimmer over 
                time, and different materials will decay at different rates. When a combination of light sources is used, such as 
                with an OLED that uses individual red/green/blue emitters, the varying rates of emitter decay eventually cause the 
                color rendering of the display to drift. For example, many displays will begin to show whites that tint towards 
                yellow over time. Both W-OLED and QD-OLED are display designs geared towards minimizing this effect.
            </p>
            <p class="article">If we take a deeper look inside an existing W-OLED panel, we would find that the white subpixels 
                are actually made up of multiple light sources. Initially, these subpixels were made up of blue LEDs together 
                with a yellow phosphor, but LG Display moved on to using a combination of red, green, and blue emitters to create 
                the white subpixels. These various emitters are mixed and sized in proportions that ensure they would all decay 
                near a constant rate, leading to minimal color shift over time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="aHead">What about OLED burn-in?</h2>
            <p class="article">With QD-OLED, all of the subpixels are backed by the same blue light source, so color shifting 
                should be next to non-existent. However, blue organic materials generally have shorter lifespans compared to 
                red and green materials, so the subpixels in QD-OLED may actually dim faster than W-OLED over time✝. This may 
                also mean that QD-OLED could be more prone to burn-in, which occurs when parts of the display have aged 
                noticeably more (or less) than their surrounding. Of course, we’ll just have to wait and see if this becomes an issue.
            </p>
            <p class="article">One other fundamental OLED design is the PenTile subpixel matrix most commonly found in smartphone
                 displays. In principle, it works similar to how W-OLED packs its white subpixels: with a combination of red, 
                 green, and blue emitters in varying numbers and sizes so that they decay more uniformly. More specifically, the 
                 PenTile design is more abundant with smaller green subpixels since they’re the most efficient, while the blue 
                 subpixels are made much larger to lengthen their shorter lifespan.
            </p>

            <p class="article">Looking into the future, the next natural progression of OLED is to take out the organic materials 
                entirely, leaving us with an LED display of a different kind. OLED is heavily limited by the effectiveness of the 
                blue organic material, so synthesizing an alternative light source opens up the gates to a whole new generation of 
                screens. Out in the visible horizon, Samsung Display has been working on yet another display tech called QNED, 
                which stands for Quantum Nano Emitting Diode. This design is similar to QD-OLED, but instead of using organic blue 
                materials, QNED uses Gallium Nitride Nanorod LEDs as the light source while still using quantum dots to mold it. 
                We’ll have an explainer for that, too, once it comes to fruition.
